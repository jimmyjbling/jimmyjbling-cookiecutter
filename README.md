This is a cookiecutter I use for my Python projects. It includes a basic structure for 
documentation using Sphinx, automatic publishing to Read the Docs, and a GitHub Actions
workflow for building and testing the project. It uses Poetry for managing dependencies.

You can build a new project using this template by running:

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
cookiecutter https://github.com/jimmyjbling/jimmyjbling-cookiecutter
```

You could also clone the repo and install it locally
